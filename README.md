# MEXC USDC Unfreezer üîì

A Python tool to diagnose and resolve frozen USDC funds on MEXC exchange. This tool helps users who have USDC showing as "frozen" or "used" when there are no visible open orders in the MEXC interface.

Have you ever experienced:
- USDC balance showing as "frozen" or "used" on MEXC
- No visible open orders in the exchange interface
- Unable to trade with your USDC funds
- The "Unfreeze" button in trading bots not working

This tool finds hidden orders across all USDC trading pairs and cancels them, instantly freeing your funds.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive Diagnosis**: Scans all USDC trading pairs for hidden orders
- **Automatic Order Cancellation**: Cancels all found orders with one command
- **Multi-Account Check**: Checks spot, margin, and futures accounts
- **Manual Order Management**: Cancel specific orders by ID
- **Safe & Secure**: Uses official MEXC API, no withdrawal permissions needed

- API key with spot trading and read permissions (NO withdrawal permission needed)

## üöÄ Usage

1. Run the tool:
```bash
python mexc_usdc_unfreezer.py

## üìñ How It Works

The tool works by:

1. **Fetching your balance** to see how much USDC is frozen
2. **Scanning all USDC trading pairs** for open orders (BTC/USDC, ETH/USDC, etc.)
3. **Finding hidden orders** that may not show in the web interface
4. **Cancelling all found orders** to release the frozen funds
5. **Checking other account types** (margin, futures) for trapped funds

## üéØ Real Example

```
Diagnosis Result:
- USDC Total: 159.83454274
- USDC Free: 0.0
- USDC Frozen: 159.83454274
- Found 8 hidden BTC/USDC orders locking exactly 159.83454274 USDC

After running unfreezer:
- Successfully cancelled 8 orders
- USDC Free: 159.83454274 ‚úÖ
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- Check that you've copied the key and secret correctly

**"Funds still frozen after running:"**
- Check MEXC website for funds in:
  - Sub-accounts
  - Earn/Savings products
  - Pending withdrawals
- Wait a few minutes and try again (sometimes there's a delay)

**"No orders found but funds still frozen:"**
